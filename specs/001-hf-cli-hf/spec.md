# Feature Specification: Scheduled HF CLI Downloader

**Feature Branch**: `[001-hf-cli-hf]`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "构建一个定时触发的 hf cli 下载器，它可以读取 HF 相关的系统环境变量。下载的模型从本地的 models.json 中读取，下载完成后，更新 models.json 中的状态，而且只下载 unfinished 的模型。定时功能可以通过配置文件设置，比如是每天晚上几点，还是每周六几点等等。这个下载器可以后台运行，也可以通过 cli 停止。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a machine learning practitioner, I want to automatically download Hugging Face models on a scheduled basis so that I can have all required models available when needed without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid models.json file with unfinished models, **When** the scheduled time arrives, **Then** the system must download the next unfinished model and update its status to completed upon success.

2. **Given** the downloader is running in background mode, **When** I issue the stop command via CLI, **Then** the system must gracefully shut down and stop any pending downloads.

3. **Given** a configuration file specifying daily downloads at 10 PM, **When** the system time reaches 10 PM, **Then** the downloader must automatically start processing unfinished models.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during download?
- How does system handle insufficient disk space?
- What happens when models.json is corrupted or malformed?
- How does system handle invalid HF environment variables?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST read and process HF (Hugging Face) related system environment variables for authentication and configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST read model download requirements from a local models.json file
- **FR-003**: System MUST only process models with "unfinished" status in models.json
- **FR-004**: System MUST update model status in models.json upon successful download completion
- **FR-005**: System MUST support configurable scheduling through a configuration file
- **FR-006**: System MUST support multiple schedule types including daily specific times and weekly specific days/times
- **FR-007**: System MUST be capable of running in background mode
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide CLI interface to stop the running downloader
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle download failures and update model status appropriately
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide logging for download activities and system status

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle HF environment variable authentication via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific auth method not specified - HF_TOKEN, user/pass, OAuth?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST retry failed downloads [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retry count and backoff strategy not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Model**: Represents a Hugging Face model to be downloaded, containing attributes like model name, download status, size, and metadata
- **Schedule Configuration**: Defines when downloads should occur, including frequency, specific times, and days
- **Download Session**: Tracks individual download attempts with start time, end time, status, and any error information
