# Tasks: Scheduled HF CLI Downloader

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-hf-cli-hf/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: tech stack (Python 3.12), libraries (huggingface_hub, schedule, click, sqlite3)
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities (Model, ScheduleConfiguration, DownloadSession, SystemConfiguration)
   → contracts/: CLI contract + Database contract
   → research.md: Technology decisions and architecture
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project structure, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, quickstart validation
   → Core: database models, core services, CLI commands
   → Integration: database connections, logging, scheduling, download management
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies (Must follow this order)
- Setup (T001-T003) before all other tasks
- Contract tests (T004-T013) MUST pass before corresponding implementation
- Integration tests (T014-T018) before core services implementation
- Models (T021-T025) before services (T026-T029)
- Services (T026-T029) before CLI commands (T030-T035)
- Core implementation before integration (T039-T053)
- All implementation before polish (T054-T071)

### File-based Dependencies
- src/hf_downloader/models/database.py (T021-T024) blocks all database-dependent tasks
- src/hf_downloader/core/config.py (T026) blocks all configuration-dependent tasks
- src/hf_downloader/cli/main.py (T030) blocks all CLI command tasks

## Notes

### TDD Compliance
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing corresponding functionality
- Commit after each task to maintain clean history
- Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle strictly

### Quality Gates
- All contract tests must pass before implementation
- All integration tests must validate user stories
- Performance tests must meet specified requirements
- Documentation must be comprehensive and up-to-date

### Risk Mitigation
- Network failures: Implement robust retry logic
- Disk space: Monitor and handle insufficient space scenarios
- Process management: Proper signal handling and cleanup
- Database integrity: Transactions and proper error handling

### Success Criteria
- CLI tool installs and runs correctly
- Scheduled downloads execute as configured
- Manual downloads work with proper progress tracking
- Background process management is stable
- All quickstart scenarios work as documented
- Performance meets requirements for concurrent downloads

## Task Generation Validation

✅ **All contracts have corresponding tests**: T004-T013 cover CLI and database contracts
✅ **All entities have model tasks**: T021-T024 cover all 4 entities from data-model.md
✅ **All tests come before implementation**: Contract tests (T004-T013) before core implementation (T021+)
✅ **Parallel tasks truly independent**: [P] tasks only for different files with no dependencies
✅ **Each task specifies exact file path**: All tasks include precise file locations
✅ **No task modifies same file as another [P] task**: Careful file separation maintained
