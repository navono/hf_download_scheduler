# Feature Specification: Scheduled HF Downloads with Time Window Control

**Feature Branch**: `[002-hf-22-00]`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "HF 下载器已经实现了主体功能。根据实际情况，我需要在晚上 22:00 点到第二天白天 7:00 开启下载（因为这段时间的下行速度更高），如果下载队列有多项，那么需要下载完第一项后，在前面的时间范围内，需要在更新完下载状态后，继续下载队列中的其他模型"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Scheduled downloads with time window 22:00-07:00
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Time window: 22:00 to next day 07:00
   → Download queue processing with status updates
   → Automatic continuation after completion
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens if download exceeds time window?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should paused downloads resume automatically?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User wants automatic downloads during off-peak hours
   → Queue processing with automatic continuation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Time-based download control
   → Queue management with status updates
   → Automatic continuation behavior
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Download schedule, download queue, download status
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Several clarifications needed for edge cases
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want the HF downloader to automatically operate during high-speed download hours (22:00-07:00), processing my download queue sequentially and continuing to the next item after each completion, so I can maximize download efficiency without manual intervention.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current time is within 22:00-07:00 window, **When** downloads are scheduled, **Then** system must start downloading the first item in queue
2. **Given** a download completes successfully, **When** time is still within the window, **Then** system must automatically start downloading the next item in queue
3. **Given** the current time is outside 22:00-07:00 window, **When** download is attempted, **Then** system must not start new downloads
4. **Given** a download fails, **When** error occurs, **Then** system must update status and continue with next item if time allows

### Edge Cases
- What happens when download is in progress at 07:00? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it pause, continue, or be cancelled?]
- How does system handle time zone changes? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should time window be based on local time or UTC?]
- What happens if system is offline during scheduled time? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should missed downloads be rescheduled?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically start downloads only during the time window 22:00 to 07:00 (next day)
- **FR-002**: System MUST process download queue sequentially, completing one item before starting the next
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically continue downloading next item in queue after current download completes
- **FR-004**: System MUST update download status after each download completion
- **FR-005**: System MUST monitor current time and enforce time window restrictions
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle download failures gracefully and continue with next item if time allows
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear indication of current operational state (active/paused based on time)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Download Schedule**: Defines the active time window (22:00-07:00) for download operations
- **Download Queue**: Collection of models to be downloaded sequentially
- **Download Status**: Current state of each download item (pending, downloading, completed, failed)
- **Time Controller**: Manages enforcement of time-based download restrictions
